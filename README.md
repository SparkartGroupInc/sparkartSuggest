# sparkartSuggest

jQuery plugin for suggesting results in text inputs.

## Usage

In order to use sparkartSuggest you'll need to include jQuery, jquery.sparkartSuggest.js, and jquery.sparkartSuggest.css.

**A basic suggest input**

```html
<input id="suggestive" type="text" value="javascript,jquery" />
<script>
	$('#suggestive').sparkartSuggest({
		source: ['java','javascript','java beans','java the country','java strikes back']
	});
</script>
```

## Configuration

* **source** - *(array,function)* - An array of strings to use as suggestions. Alternatively, a function that returns a list of suggestions. An example source function:

```javascript
function( string, options, callback ){
	$.getJSON( '/suggestions?q='+ string, function( suggestions ){
		callback( suggestions );
	});
}
```
* **threshold** - *(integer)* - The number of characters that must be typed before suggestions start to appear. Defaults to `2`.
* **max** - *(integer)* - The maximum number of suggestions to show. Defaults to `8`.
* **delay** - *(integer)* - How long (in milliseconds) the plugin waits before loading suggestions. Defaults to `150`.
* **disableDefaultAutocomplete** - *(boolean)* - Many browsers have a built-in autocomplete option that can interfere with this plugin, this will attempt to disable that.  Defaults to `true`.
* **sorter** - *(function)* - A function used to sort returned results. This is the default sorter:

```javascript
function( a, b ){
	return ( a < b )? -1: ( a > b )? 1: 0;
}
```
* **comparator** - *(function)* - A function used to determine which strings match. This is the default comparator:

```javascript
function( source, string ){
	// http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3446170/escape-string-for-use-in-javascript-regex#answer-6969486
	var regex_safe_string = string.replace( /[\-\[\]\/\{\}\(\)\*\+\?\.\\\^\$\|]/g, '\\$&' );
	var regex = new RegExp( '^'+ regex_safe_string, 'i' );
	return regex.test( source ) && string !== source;
}
```
